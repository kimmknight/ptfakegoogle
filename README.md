**ptfakegoogle** is a web page that you can use in Packet Tracer to simulate Google Search.

It can be a good way for learners to test "internet access" within a PT scenario.

It is a single HTML page with no images. It allows the client to type something in the search box and click the search button. Regardless of what is searched for, it will provide fake results for "potatoes".

I usually add *index.html* to the HTTP/S service on a server. I also setup a DNS A record to point *google.com* to the server's IP address.
